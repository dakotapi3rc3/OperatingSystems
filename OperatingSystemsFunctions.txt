Windows 10 is a great operating system, but what is most important is the level of customizability and abundance of the OS.
Windows is fantastic when it comes to adjusting things to your liking, apps like rainmeter can be downloaded and implemented to format the homescreen exactly as you want.
The home screen also has a start button located which allows you to search all program files and pull any relavent data, in WIN 10 you just start typing!
